	DOC(4.1): <section><center> <b><u> ## Unconference. </b></u></center><br><br>An unconference, also called an open space conference, is a participant-driven meeting. Unconferences are gatherings that try to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional talking head conferences, such as fees, sponsored presentations, and top-down organization.The agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space. Unconferences typically feature open discussions rather than having a single speaker at the front of the room giving a talk. Participants, both knowledgeable and interested in legal technology topics, will determine what topics of interest will be discussed, who will lead the conversations and where the conversations will take place. Led by Dazza Greenwood of M.I.T. (lawyer and computer scientist), this unconference will address questions and explore areas of interest involving a wide range of legal technology application, implication and implementation conversations. <br><br>The Hackathon and Unconference will be taking place in the same location concurrently so those attending the Unconference will have the opportunity to wander and explore among and between Hackathon teams and get a first-hand view of what happens in the hackathon environment. The Unconference format is designed to encourage this exploration and experience.<br>

	DOC(10.1): <section><br> <center><b><u>## FAQ</u></b></center><br>Answers to some of your most pressing questions<br><br>
<u>What is a legal hackathon?</u><br><i>It's a gathering of thinkers, dreamers, and doers who come together, typically over a weekend, to share ideas and build solutions to the challenges set. It is basically a pop-up innovation lab, where you will meet and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds. If you want to be part of creating something interesting that makes a difference to our justice system, this event is for you!</i><br><br><u>Isn't hacking illegal?</u><br><i>Not this kind, but remember to be aware of the possible intellectual property rights of others.</i><br><br><u>Who can participate? And what does it cost?</u><br><i>Anyone* can participate! Hackathon teams will be groups of diverse people, with different skillsets and experience. You do not need to know how to code or have other technical skills in order to participate. The sole requirement: you have an interest in working creatively with a diverse team to create access to justice. There is NO COST to participate in the hackathon.</i><br> *Must be at least 18 years old.<br><br><u>What can I expect to experience at the hackathon?</u><br><i>You can expect to think, do, and learn a lot! The event will begin with informational and team-forming sessions, then we will break out into teams, where the magic will happen.</i><br><br><u>How do I form or join a team?</u><br><i>Teams are generally a group of 3 - 5 people with diverse skills, and ideally include at least one coder. You can register as a team or register individually and join a team the day of the hackathon. We will have ideation and formation activities before the hackathon starts, to help teams form.</i><br><br><u>What should I bring?</u><br> <i>Bring your laptop. We'll provide power, internet access, snacks, beverages, and lunch. Are their prizes for hackathon winners? Because the ultimate goal of this hackathon is to create a tangible access-to-justice technology tool, our judges will be awarding a grant for the winning project. The grant money will go to the stakeholder (legal nonprofit) that is served by the winning project and will enable the stakeholder to fund further development of the solution.</i><br><br><u>Who owns the hackathon project and the IP?</u><br> <i>Information about the intellectual property (IP) rights in any work product resulting from Hackathon activities may be found in the Participation Agreement for the <x>hostchapter</x> Hackathon.</i><br><br><u>Is there a hackathon code of conduct?</u><i><br>Yes! Go here to read the code of conduct (long version) that <x>hostchapter</x> Legal Hackers have adopted for this Hackathon.</i> <br><br>Anyone needing accommodations may contact us at <x>contactemail</x></b></u> <br><br></section>
